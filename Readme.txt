This project is called Mastermind. It is a game with six colors. There are many combanations of those colors, and the computer will randomly choose one combanation without repeating numbers. The user have to guess that combanation. However, every time after the human have guessed, the human will get a hint of how many of their inputs are in the right location and how many of them are not in the right location but in the answer. Upon receiving these clues, the human will be able to get the answer without taking forever.

When I received this project, I thought about using two classes, one takes the input and runs the code, and the other one excecute the game. I first wrote the tester class. In the tester class, I put all the user input in an arraylist and pass it into the mastermind class. In the masstermind class, there are two classes. One is check_correct, which checks the amount of input that are in the right location and the amount of input that are in the wrong location but inside the answer. Another method prints the board. With these methods and classes, I could finish the game. I had all the logics already before I wrote the code, so there isn't really a lot of frustrations for me.
